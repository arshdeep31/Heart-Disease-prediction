# Heart-Disease-prediction
Heart disease is a major issue in modern society. According to the World Health Organization, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death globally taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year. 4 in 5 deaths are due to strokes and heart attacks. Recently, data mining has proved to be an effective technique to analyze large amounts of data and provides valuable insights into it. When combined with machine learning techniques it can help to predict different heart diseases, therefore, helping in easy diagnosis and hence early treatment. In this work, we have used various machine learning algorithms to achieve the highest accuracy possible for predicting heart disease. The algorithms used are Random Forest classifier, K nearest neighbor classifier, Logistic regression classifier, and Support Vector Machine classifier. The highest accuracy was achieved by Logistic Regression Which was found out to be 91.80 %. This approach can help to improve the detection of heart disease.
